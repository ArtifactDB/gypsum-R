saveFile(
  project,
  asset,
  version,
  path,
  cache = cacheDirectory(),
  overwrite = FALSE,
  precheck = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{project}{String containing the project name.}

\item{asset}{String containing the asset name.}

\item{version}{String containing the version name.}

\item{path}{String containing the relative path to the file inside the versioned asset.}

\item{cache}{String containing the path to the cache directory.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical scalar indicating whether to overwrite an existing file in \code{cache}.
If \code{FALSE} and the file exists in \code{cache}, the download is skipped.}

\item{precheck}{Whether to check if the file exists in the bucket before attempting a download.
This may be skipped if the file is known to exist.}

\item{config}{Configuration object for the S3 bucket, see \code{\link{publicS3Config}} for details.}

\value{
The file is downloaded to the local file system. The destination file path is returned.
}
\description{
Download a file from the gypsum bucket, for a version of an asset of a project.
}
\details{
If \code{precheck=TRUE} and no file exists in the bucket at \code{path}, 
this function will check the \code{..links} file to check whether \code{path} refers to a linked-from file.
If so, the contents of the link destination is downloaded to the cache and a link/copy is created at the returned file path.

out <- saveFile("test-R", "basic", "v1", "blah.txt")
