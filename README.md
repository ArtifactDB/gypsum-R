# R client to the gypsum REST API

Pretty much as it says on the can, provides an R client for the [**gypsum** REST API](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/gypsum-worker).
Readers are referred to the [API's documentation](https://gypsum-test.aaron-lun.workers.dev) or the [user guide](vignettes/userguide.Rmd) for more details.
